# movie-recommender-system
This project is a Movie Recommender System built using text vectorization techniques and implemented with Streamlit. The system aims to suggest movies to users based on their preferences, utilizing natural language processing (NLP) to understand and analyze the textual data associated with the movies

# Features
Text Vectorization: The core of the recommendation engine relies on text vectorization methods to convert movie descriptions and other textual data into numerical vectors.
Content-Based Filtering: Recommendations are generated based on the similarity of movie content, focusing on genres, plots, and other descriptive attributes.
Interactive UI: A user-friendly interface created with Streamlit allows users to interact with the recommender system seamlessly.
Dynamic Recommendations: The system dynamically updates recommendations based on user input, providing a personalized movie-watching experience.

# Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

**1.Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Navnit7352/movie-recommender-system.git
cd movies-recommender-system ```

**2.Install the dependencies:**
pip install -r requirements.txt

**3.Run the Streamlit app:**

# Usage
Input Preferences: Users can input their movie preferences through the Streamlit interface.
Get Recommendations: The system processes the input and displays a list of recommended movies.
Explore Details: Users can explore more details about each recommended movie, including its description, genre, and other relevant information.

# How It Works
Data Collection: Movie data, including descriptions, genres, and other attributes, is collected and preprocessed.
Text Vectorization: The textual data is transformed into numerical vectors using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or Word Embeddings.
Similarity Calculation: The similarity between movies is calculated using cosine similarity or other distance metrics.
Recommendation Generation: Based on the similarity scores, a list of recommended movies is generated and displayed to the user.

# Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language used for the implementation.
Streamlit: A powerful framework for building interactive web applications.
NLP Libraries: Libraries such as NLTK, SpaCy, or scikit-learn for text preprocessing and vectorization.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations and computations.
