# movie-recommender-system
This project is a Movie Recommender System built using text vectorization techniques and implemented with Streamlit. The system aims to suggest movies to users based on their preferences, utilizing natural language processing (NLP) to understand and analyze the textual data associated with the movies

# Features
Text Vectorization: The core of the recommendation engine relies on text vectorization methods to convert movie descriptions and other textual data into numerical vectors.
Content-Based Filtering: Recommendations are generated based on the similarity of movie content, focusing on genres, plots, and other descriptive attributes.
Interactive UI: A user-friendly interface created with Streamlit allows users to interact with the recommender system seamlessly.
Dynamic Recommendations: The system dynamically updates recommendations based on user input, providing a personalized movie-watching experience.
